I did not know this step was suppsosed to be done through Gitpod or Github codespaces.
So installed the AWS CLI from AWS Docs
I did the following steps to install AWS CLI
I installed the AWS CLI via command in **Command Prompt**:
```

aws --version
```
I attempted to run the command by typing in `aws` but I recieved an error
